%New transaction type, similar to slasher.
%Each validator needs a minimum amount of money in their account.
%If you can provide evidence that someone doesn't have enough money left to validate, you can take some of their money, which simultaniously deletes all their delegation, and changes the consensus_flag in the channels to off.
%Otherwise it would be possible to reduce the total number of validators without paying a fee.

%problem, this changes the power of the block...
