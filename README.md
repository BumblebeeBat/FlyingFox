A security flaw was found in this software that is difficult to fix. I am planning on starting over with a new github project.
The flaw is that if the coins are distributed too thinly amount too many people, that it becomes cheap to bribe the validators to keep a fork alive.

lightning consensus is a bad idea. combining the consensus mechanism with the channel mechanism is a bad idea.
It does increase the amount of voice we get in making consensus decisions, but there are other more efficient ways to achieve this goal.
