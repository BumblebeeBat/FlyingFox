Flying Fox is my attempt to achieve the goals of the truthcoin project: http://www.truthcoin.info/ I respect Paul Sztorc, especially in his ability to communicate truthcoin, which he invented. Him and I are using very different strategies to try and build the same thing.

Sztorc maintains a forum where the different teams trying to build truthcoin can share ideas: http://forum.hive-mind.info/
