Flying Fox is an effort achieve the goals of truthcoin, with more scalability: http://www.truthcoin.info/

It deviates from the design choices of truthcoin in several ways:

*Not based on bitcoin, it is a new blockchain.

*An Erlang/OTP package 

*Allows betting in any language, including EVM, Spanish, Python, C, Chinese, and English. 

*Uses lightening network channels for payments and for betting. 

*Proof of stake blockchain where each peer's power in the consensus process is determined by how much money they have locked in channels.

Code of conduct, development guidelines: Submit pull requests. If I like, and it passes tests, I will accept. Feel free to ask me questions or make github issues.

Install instructions:

Eventually Flying Fox will be a simple executable you click on. For now it is a bit more complex.

First, make sure you have erlang installed. Version 18 is prefered, but older versions will probably work. Here is one way to download it: http://www.erlang.org/download.html , then run the script.

sh install.sh


Start your node with this script:

sh start.sh
