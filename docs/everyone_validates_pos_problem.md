A problem with proof of stake systems that are based on how much money you have is that most people are off-line most of the time. If a large portion of money is off-line, the money that is on-line has a larger portion of control. Making people leave their computer on 24/7 with an unencrypted private key in the ram is annoying and dangrously insecure. We need a way to delegate control to a subset of participants who are willing to leave their computers on.
