$18 million in annual revenue: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weedmaps

A decentralized version of this service would be a lot better than the centralized version. It would be made up of thousands of oracles. Most oracles would be restricted to a small region, like a city. The many small oracles would be able to focus on more stuff at once than weedmaps is able to.

An oracle is a way for the blockchain to learn about facts of the world. Like who won a football game. Or where the nearest Starbucks is from my location.
You can read more about how oracles work in the oracle.md file.

At least one truthcoin oracle needs be created and trained in each city. Once the oracle works, it is very affordable to add new businesses to the city map. 

A store owner of Smart and Final asks the oracle a question: "Does a Smart and Final exist at X address?"

Then the members of the oracle for that city would visit the establishment to verify whether it exists.

It would be nice if the oracle participants didn't have to own a computer. They should only need a USB thumb drive.
Once a week they borrow a computer to vote.
