The Tendermint team can't measure cost of consensus

The tendermint team is driving blind. They don't know how to calculate the cost of maintaining consensus. They reject the standard accepted method of calculating cost, and don't have any alternative.
The tendermint team has no idea how much their consensus will cost.

The standard algorithm for calculating cost of consensus is:
(cost of mining hardware) + (cost of electricity from mining) + (interest rate applied to any security deposits)

There is no alternative to this algorithm that I am aware of. Tendermint is the only team that rejects it.

Security deposits in Tendermint are called "Atoms".

According to Ethan: "Atoms aren't a measure of currency or wealth. They're surgical equipment"

According to Jae: "It’s really just about opportunity cost.  What’s the opportunity cost of holding atoms, for a validator?  I’d argue zero, or negative.  It holds precisely those number of atoms because that’s the best thing it can do with its wealth."
