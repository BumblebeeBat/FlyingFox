When you move an application onto a blockchain, you are making a trade-off. 
The benefit is that you can have a program with rules that many people can interact with, and no one can break any rule. 
The cost is that processing speed is limited by the slowest node that has to process the data, and by network latency, and the data is duplicated on every node, so it is expensive to store, and you are limited by the amount of space on the smallest node.

If an application only involves 3 participants, we can make a shard of the blockchain, which is like a tiny blockchain on top of the other. Those 3 participants could be much more affordable because the data is duplicated only 3 times instead of 1000's. They don't have to trust each other.
