A "hard fork" is another name for "creating a new competing blockchain". When people say "we hardforked the blockchain to fix the security hole", what they really mean is "the old blockchain died, and we made a new one that is very similar, but doesn't have the flaw of the old one".

When a hard fork happens, everyone needs to upgrade software.

Hard forks are not fork resistant. Multiple teams could propose them simultaniously. There is no way to say one team's version is more correct than another's.

Any cryptocurrency that depends on hard forks for security is using a centralized mechanism to decide which of the possible hard forks is the real one.
Any cryptocurrency that depends on hard forks for security can be pushed into a centralized state by a majority of the validators.
