Some nodes have external IP (called servers), and others do not (called users). 
The servers can turn on various services, it is possible to add new services.
For examples, clients register servers so that they can send payment through the server to other clients who have registered with it.

The same route that is used for payments is used for messaging, for betting, and for playing games.

Nodes with external IP will host an html webpage explaining the various services. It will have a list of people who are already registered. Those are the people you can spend to through this server.

Eventually we will connect the servers so that you can send messages and play games with people who are registered to a different server.
