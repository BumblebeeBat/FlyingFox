Reputation is an idea from the Bitcoin Hivemind project: http://bitcoinhivemind.com/

The owners of reputation are the participants in the oracle. If they are honest, they should get more reputation. If they are dishonest, they should lose reputation.

The limitation with reputation is that the total amount of money in the markets has to be worth less than how much the reputation is worth. So, if we want to occasionally have high volume markets, we need the reputation to be worth a lot. Keeping money in reputation is expensive by the interest rate. If your money is invested in rep, you can't also invest it elsewhere.


This paper improves on Bitcoin Hivemind's protocol by heavily reducing the amount of money that needs to be locked up. The amount of money locked in safety deposits only ever needs be as big as the current amount of value being judged over in the moment.

The oracle participants will need to put up safety deposits to promise they wont judge on the bet twice. The volume of safety deposits in a market must exceed three times the total value of bets bring judged at that moment.

Example:

if there are 1000 markets, each with $10,000 of gambling, then there would be $10 million being gambled in truthcoin.

Using my new method only $30,000 would need be locked up in safety deposits at any one moment. It only takes 10 minutes to collect votes. Locking up $30,000 for only 10 minutes is very affordable.

Using the old reputation as a currency method, there would need to be a minimum of $10 million locked up in reputation 24/7, very expensive.


It is bad to reuse bonds to different things. Every judgment needs a seperate safety deposit. We shouldn't use a large pool of reputation currency for all the different judgments.

If you reuse the same money for events that don't occur at the same time, then the money needs to be locked up a long time, this is expensive. By making each bond only do one thing, we can unlock it as quickly as possible, which is more affordable.
