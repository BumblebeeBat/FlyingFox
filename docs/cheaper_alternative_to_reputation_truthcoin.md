Instead of needing to lock up the maximum in rep all the time, we could make it only need to lock up the current value being judged in that moment.

The oracle participants will need to put up safety deposits that they wont judge on the bet twice. The volume of safety deposits in a market must exceed the total value of bets at the time of judgement.

So if there are 1000 markets, each with $10,000 of gambling, then there would be $10 million being gambled in truthcoin.

Using my new method at most $10,000 would need be locked up in safety deposits at any one moment. It only takes an 10 minutes to collect votes. Locking up $10,000 for only 10 minutes is very affordable.

Using the old reputation as a currency method, there would need to be a minimum of $10 million locked up in reputation 24/7, very expensive.
