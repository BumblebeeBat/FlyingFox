should we charge 99 coins of electricity to produce 100 coins on the chain? or more or less?

Some businesses, when growth is critical, are willing to stay far in debt perpetually, in exchange for getting more users.
This reminds me of charging 99 to produce 100. Growth matters more than keeping out value. It is very aggressive.

If you have a startup, and you get rounds of investment, you are typically trying to be worth a higher valuation every time you get another round of investment.
This reminds me of charging 101 electricity to produce 100 coins on the chain. Increasing in value per coin matters more than growth. It is a more defensive strategy.

Charging 100 for 100 is more balanced.

It seems like the validators should have some control to shift this price up and down.

The market cap will double about 40 times.
If someone does the effort of doubling the market cap, it makes sense to reward them with at 1% of the market cap.
