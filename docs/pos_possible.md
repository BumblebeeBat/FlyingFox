This essay http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest/
is about how pos will always be more expensive. It has a couple problems:
1) you assume that only consensus mechanisms that produce coins are viable. If you are right, then bitcoin is on a path of death. Bitcoin is slowing down coin production by half every few years. If Satoshi consensus stops working at some point, then bitcoin might want to switch to Flying Fox consensus. It is optimized for a finite non-growing money supply.
2) you only consider consensus maintained by the destruction of resources that cost the same amount for both coin-holders, and people who don't own coins. like POW and liquidity and elections. There exists a resource that is affordable for coin-holders, and expensive for non-coin-holders. (the coins)

Here is a very simple counterexample: Every coin holder is forced to stay online 24/7. The portion of coins you have is how much control you have to add the next block.
There is no way to force the addition of blocks, or censor a block, unless you are part of a coalition of >51% of coin owners who wants the same thing.
None of the coins are "bonded". you can spend them to whoever you want during any block. We aren't losing value by the interest rate.

The cost of consensus is very low, practically zero, but the cost of owning coins is excessively high. Leaving a computer on 24/7 is unreasonable for most users.
