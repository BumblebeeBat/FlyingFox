Instead of going to a market of investors, Flying Fox is going to the market of laborers. It is creating jobs. People talk to each other about what jobs are available. Advertisements tend to be ignored, but wanted ads get lots of attention. 

Crowdfunding dapps will pay people for creating public goods like roads and bridges and software. People who want a bridge built will do free advertising.

Smart contracts will pay people to walk around their neighborhood and record locations and hours of stores. Store owners are willing to pay to be added to a map online.
People will be paid to record bus routes.

Dapps don't have to obey laws because no human controls them. Flying Fox will circumvent the law to gain exclusive access to lucrative markets.
Using Flying Fox you can write smart contracts to hire workers at less than minimum wage.
You can pay for books or movies to be uploaded as a torrent.
You can avoid paying for healthcare for your workers.

Bad press is good press.
