Flying Fox combines the magic of prediction markets with the power of a decentralized network to create a stunningly accurate forecasting tool - and the chance for real money trading profits

Blockchain app platform.

Flying Fox is a decentralized platform that allows for smart contracts: agreements between pairs of users that are enforced without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third party interference.

These contracts are enforced by a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around. This enables developers to create markets, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without counterparty risk.

The project will be crowdfunded soon. It is developed by the Zack Hess, with contributions from great minds across the globe.
