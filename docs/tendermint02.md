Tendermint is unprepared for soft fork attacks.

It costs 2/3rds of the validating power to get the ability to censor any transactions. The ability to censor transactions is the same as the ability to steal any money on the chain.
Since the amount you can steal is bigger than the cost of committing the attack, Tendermint is vulnerable to this attack.

The Tendermint team has no plan in place to stop this type of attack from occuring.

The only mechanism I am aware of to stop this kind of attack is like this:
The distribution of people who can cause soft forks should be as similar to the distriution of value holders as possible.
