Flying Fox is going to have two crowdsales. We need money to pay the developer, and to fund the bounties.
Profits from these sales will be used to:
* Build and host a block explorer for Flying Fox.
* Build and host a spam-free messaging client. If you mark a message as spam, the sender loses a security deposit.
* maintain, host, and provide initial liquidity for an off-chain Augur/Truthcoin prediction market system in the lightning network.
* Build other blockchain technology that will help convert the world from fiat to cryptocurrency. 
* Paying for a space with blackboards where the developer can work with bounty hunters.
* repay investors who participated in the previous round of funding. approximately $40,000

Why would you want to participate in the first crowdsale?

The first sale will be for Reputation in the first truthcoin oracle on the blockchain. This is very similar to the Augur crowdsale on the ethereum blockchain. You will earn profit every time users need your help to settle a bet.

After the oracle has proven that it works, we will sell the coins in the second crowdsale.

Why would you want to participate in this second crowdsale?
* You will recieve coins on the Flying Fox blockchain. It is currently 100% PoS, no new coins will be created. It uses lightning network consensus, has a turning complete programming language optimized for off-chain contracts.
* You will be helping to create a world without counterfeiters. 
* At this point in time it will already have a truthcoin prediction market.

* The coins might lose all their value.

* The technology is experimental, it could break for days at a time. It will recover as quickly and accurately as we can manage.
