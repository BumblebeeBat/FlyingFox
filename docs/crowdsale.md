Flying Fox is going to have a crowdsale. We need money to pay the developer, and to fund the bounties.
Profits from these sales will be used to:
* Build and host a block explorer for Flying Fox.
* Build and host a spam-free messaging client. If you mark a message as spam, the sender loses a security deposit.
* maintain, host, and provide initial liquidity for an off-chain Augur/Truthcoin prediction market system in the lightning network.
* Build other blockchain technology that will help convert the world from fiat to cryptocurrency. 
* Paying for a space with blackboards where the developer can work with bounty hunters.
* repay investors who participated in the previous round of funding. approximately $40,000
* write the oracle in the scripting language so we can have financial derivatives and prediction markets.

Planning:
We need a webpage for this. Users who solve a captcha, provide an address, and choose a maximum price will be given a temporary deposit address to send their bitcoin too. They get recorded onto a list of the initial distribution of coin holders.

If the price turns out higher than your chosen maximum, we give you a refund instead.
We should let users provide a signature to revise their maximum price upward.
