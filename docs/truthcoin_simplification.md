We need the outcome of the decision to be decided using a decentralized method called the oracle protocol.

The way truthcoin is currently designed, rewarding the oracle participants is a decentralized process.
Does rewarding the oracle participants need to be decentralized?

What if I have centralized control of a switch. After the decision is already made, after the gamblers collect their winnings, I have control over which way to flip the switch. If I flip it one way, then the honest half of the oracle participants get more rep, and dishonest ones lose rep. If I flip it the other way, then the liars get more rep, and the honest participants lose rep.

Would this be as secure as a fully-decentralized version of truthcoin?

Assuming betting is happening in channels, the gamblers should be able to instantly switch from one central leader to a different one, if one should make a mistake.
If I make a mistake as central leader, it would be easy for anyone else to take my list of reps, and start a competing oracle that rewards rep correctly.

The central leader don't have direct control over the outcomes of decisions, so he can't steal anyone's coins.

In Augur there are coins called "rep". The maximum amount of money being gambled in the markets at one time must be < the total value of all the rep. This makes the cost of using augur or making markets in augur very high.
Using the simplification, every market has a seperate safety deposit stopping the judges from double-signing. The safety deposit only needs to be held for long enough for all the gamblers to collect their winnings. So this is much more affordable than rep.
