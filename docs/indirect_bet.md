3. Betting through a 3rd party

Having a channel costs money, so you wouldn't want to have too many. If you have a channel with a popular node, you can bet through them to anyone else. The downside of doing this is that the money has to be locked up in both channels at once. The person in the middle is collecting arbitrage.

4. Moving a bet to a more direct path

If your bet is on an expensive multi-step path, you can move it to a cheap one-step path on the next block. You create a new channel directly to the person you are betting with. You use a hashlock to simultaniously cancel the bet on one path and activate it on the other.
