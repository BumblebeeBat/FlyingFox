I agree with Vlad that "censorship" is a better name for this attack.

Punishing online validators isn't enough. The entire team of validators could be online and working together to cause censorship.

There are parts of the system that you can't hide with crypto. Like the tx fee that goes to the validators. The validators could do a soft fork to change the tx fee for example.

Refusing to transact after observing censorship isn't always possible. Sometimes you only have probablistic evidence that censorship is occuring.
Even if you do have proof of censorship halting all txs isn't a good failure mode. It is often worse.

Hard forks will eventually be politically impossible, and they aren't decentralized.
