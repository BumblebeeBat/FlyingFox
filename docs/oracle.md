From the truthcoin whitepaper

""" 
An "oracle corporation‚Äù model  attempts to guarantee that  a group of self-selected,  anonymous,  greedy users  will always resolve contract - outcomes honestly.  Outcomes are  established by weighted - vote, according to users'  ownership of a  second type of "VoteCoin" , of  which there are a constant  amount (granting Sybil-immunity) . Ownership of the VoteCoins is  redistributed according to a Schelling Coordination Game, which  destabilizes malicious cartels  only. Large individual malicious - votes  a redistributed according to a Sch
elling Coordination Game, which 
destabilizes malicious cartels 
only. Large individual malicious-votes are discouraged through [1] collapse in the market value  of Votecoins  and [2] threat of (rare, Sybil - resistant) M iner Vetoes and Overrides. Like  equities,  VoteCoins are tradable and pay dividends over time, removing  the incentive for an "exit scam".

The steps for a single oracle decision:

1) several questions get proposed to the oracle.

2) The oracle members lock-in what they think the outcome is without revealing their decision.

3) Everyone in the oracle reveals how they voted. We run an algorithm on the results to calculate how much power each member now has. The algorithm is designed to punish the dishonest, and reward the honest.


Flying Fox oracles are different from truthcoin oracles in several ways:

1) In Truthcoin, the only way to create a new oracle is by copying an existing one. In Flying Fox, anyone can create additional oracles at no cost.

2) In Truthcoin it is possible for the participants in the oracle to prove how they voted. In Flying Fox it is not possible. (this makes bribery/extortion more difficult to pull off.)

3) In Truthcoin, everything the oracle does is loaded onto every computer running the software. In Flying Fox, you are only aware of:

-1) oracle results you are participating in and 

-2) oracle results where a person goes off-line for too long, and their partner wants to collect the money.
