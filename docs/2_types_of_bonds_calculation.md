Tendermint is a blockchain with only one type of bond. Lets analyse it's efficiency in comparison to Flying Fox's 2 types of bonds.

about 1/20th of tendermint's value will be locked up in bonds ready to slash, about 5%. Or more generaly, X.

about 26/4000th of Flying Fox's value will be locked up in bonds ready to slash, about 0.65%

So Tendermint's operating costs will be about 8x higher than Flying Fox's. Or more generally, X*4000/26


The cost to attack tendermint with a soft fork is as much as buying 2/3rds of the bonds, about 4% of the coins. Or more generally, X*2/3

The cost to attack Flying Fox with a soft fork is as much as buying 2/3rds of all the money in channels, around 65% of the coins.

Tendermint's security against soft forks is about 16x lower than Flying Fox's. Or more generally 2/3*3/2/X = 1/X

16*8=128. or X*4000/26/X = 128
For the same operating cost, Flying Fox consensus is 128 times more secure.

The value of tendermint bonds doesn't matter. When we use "X" as the value, the X cancels out. Flying Fox is still 128 times more efficient.
