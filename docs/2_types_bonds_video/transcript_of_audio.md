Calculation of how much more efficient a blockchain can be if its bonds are split into 2 types. Specifically we will examine the "soft fork attack", which is a type of censorship attack committed by >2/3rds of the group that has control of adding blocks.

Blockchain teams who would benefit from watching this video are: Tendermint, NXT, Ethereum Casper

For any blockchain protocol, if you double spending on security, then you are also doubling the cost to attack. 

Similarly in home security, if you build your walls twice as thick, it will cost twice as much to build, and it will cost twice as much to penetrate.
When measuring the efficiency of a home security system, you are interested in the cost to rob the house, divided by the cost to build and maintain the security system.
When looking at the "security efficiency" of a blockchain consensus protocol, we are interested in the cost to attack the system, divided by the cost to maintain the blockchain consensus.

Doubling the gas in a car's tank makes it drive twice as far.
When we compare cars, we look at miles per gallon, called "fuel efficiency". How far you can drive divided by how much it costs.
When we compare consensus protocols, we look at "security efficiency". Which is how much you would need to spend to successfully attack the consensus protocol divided by the cost to maintain consensus.

Now we will use the security efficiency metric to compare a 1-bond proof of stake blockchain with the 2-bond version.

In the case of Flying Fox, the big bond is 128 times bigger than the small bond.

For the 1-bond blockchain, the cost of maintaining consensus is the interest rate applied to the bond.
For the 2-bond blockchain, the interest rate only applies to the smaller bond which is locked up as a security deposit. The big bond is spendable, so we don't lose value by the interest rate.

For the 1-bond blockchain, the cost to attack is the same as the cost of controlling 2/3rds of the bonds.
For the 2-bond blockchain, the attack needs to be agreed upon by 2/3rds of the large bond.

Combining the two equations: (2 bond security efficiency) = (1 bond security efficiency)*(big bond)/(small bond).
In the case of Flying Fox, the big bond is 128 times bigger than the small one.
So, given the same operating costs, Flying Fox can secure a market cap that is 128 times larger than the equivalent 1-bond proof of stake system.
