It is best to have each security deposit only protects against one thing you want to stop.
If you reuse a security deposit for 2 things, and both go wrong then you are only punishing 1/2 as much as you had intended.
If you reuse a security deposit for 2 things that don't happen simultaniously, then you are holding the security deposit for a lot of time, and this is more expensive.
