If a bet is following an unnecessarily long path, then it is locking up money unnecesarily. Once the next block happens, we can move the bet to a shorter path by following a protocol like this:

Alice has a channel with Bob. Bob has a channel with Carol.

Alice and Bob are gambling on the presidential election. Bob thinks Trump will win, Alice thinks Obama will win.

Bob decides that he doesn't want to gamble, he wants to sell his shares at the current price. Alice wants to keep gambling.

Carol wants to gamble on the election. She thinks Trump will win.

Carol makes a bet with Bob. Bob bets on Hilary, Carol bets on Trump.
Bob's new bet cancels out his old bet with Alice. He is now neutral.

Alice and Carol form a channel. Using a hashlock, all 3 channels are updated simultaniously.

* The Alice-Carol channel is used to make a bet on the presidential election. Alice bets on Obama, Carol on Trump. Locking up liquidity.

* The Alice-Bob channel is emptied of bets, which unlocks liquidity.

* The Bob-Carrol channel is emptied of bets, which unlocks liquidity.
