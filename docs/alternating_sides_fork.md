An alternating sides fork is like this example:
Block N+1 is the child of N.
Block N+2 is the child of N.
Block N+M where M > 1 is the child of Block N+M-2.

As long as >1/2 of the validating power on the chain doesn't want this to happen, then they wont have 2/3rds of validators on a block frequently enough to keep the fork alive.
