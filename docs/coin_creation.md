The market cap of bitcoin is only in the billions. We want a cryptocurrency to be in the trillions as soon as possible, so that it can be used for commerce. 

The following proposal is for a POW system that would allow any amount of new coins to be created in a day. If I had a $ trillion, and I wanted to turn it all into cryptocurrency, I could. The market cap would be $1 trillion higher. The price of individual coins remains unchanged.

## Small blockchain example

Before dilution:
A owns 33% of the coins.
B owns 33% of the coins.
C owns 33% of the coins.
33% of the coins is worth about the same as 10,000 meals of food.

The investment that dilutes is:
D burns electricity worth about 10,000 meals of food in POW.

After dilution:
A owns 25%
B owns 25%
C owns 25%
D owns 25%
25% of the coins is worth the same as about 10,000 meals of food.

Maybe we should charge D a couple percentage higher or lower than that, I am not sure.

## Startup example

Startups are optimized to increase in value very quickly. We can repurpose their design choices to make a blockchain with a fast-growing market cap.

Looking at an example from the startup world. Lets say you own 10% of a small company, and someone shows up to make a huge investment, buying 50% of the company at a price that makes the company worth 10x more.
Now you don't own 10%, you only own 5%, but the company is worth 10 times more, so your investment is worth 5x more, even though you have a smaller percentage of the total. Your shares got diluted, but you still earned profit.

Now compare against a blockchain example:
Imagine a blockchain with a market cap of $4 billion.
You own 10%.
An investor wants to invest in the blockchain similarly to how they invest in startups. They want to buy in very rapidly. Over the course of a week, he spends $1 billion mining the cryptocurrency.

This should dilute your shares, and increase the market cap, just like the startup example.

The new market cap $4+$1 =  $5 billion
20% is how much they paid, so they should own 20% of the coins.
You only own 8% now, not 10%, but it is worth the same amount as before.

If you think having a fixed supply of coins is best, then answer this: Why do startups dilute shares?

## Gold, origins of money example

Money happens because everyone tries to hold assets that maintain their value for a long time, and are easy to spend.
If you have lots of wealth in food, and can't finish it before it spoils, you might use your food to pay people to dig up gold for you. The amount of gold you get will be worth about the same as the food you spent.

Blockchain mining is similar, but instead of converting food into money by labor, it converts electricity into money by computation.

With gold mining, if you double the number of labourers, then you nearly double your gold output. Regardless of how much money you own, you are able to hire laborers and convert the value to gold in a short time period. 

With bitcoin mining, any amount of effort still only produces the same amount of bitcoin.
If you are massively rich, and you put all your money into mining bitcoin in a short period, then the value of bitcoin you gain will be worth far less than your investment.

Flying Fox is designed to be more like gold. If you double your investment in mining, then the size of the reward is twice as big. It always costs 1000 coins of electricity to produce 1000 coins.

## Conservation of value example

There are 2 ways to increase the market cap of a bitcoin:
1) You can burn value by advertising
2) You can burn value by proof of work

The (1) method doesn't work well, because the person who pays for the advertising owns less than 1/2 of the coins, so gets less than 1/2 the profit.

Method (2) works well, but it is traditionally very limited. Bitcoin only allows for the creation of a small fixed number of new coins per day. If I had $1 trillion, and I wanted to turn it all into bitcoin, I could not do it. There aren't enough bitcoins in existence.

## argument from supply and demand

It is bad to connect the consensus mechanism to the coin creation mechanism, because the rate of coin creation should be determined by the demand for new coin.

Having a fixed unchanging rate of supply is bad. It makes the currency price very volatile, because the supply of new coins can't react to changes in demand.

## growing the market cap of gold example

If we needed 1 billion meals of gold to make a big purchase of oil, but all known gold stores only added up to 100 million meals, we could take 900 million meals of food, and use it to pay human laborers to produce 900 million meals worth of gold.
Then we would have 1 billion meals worth of gold, and could afford the purchase.

Telling the oil vendor that we want to pay only 10% because the market cap of gold is too low wont work.
The vendor will only sell if he gets paid in full.

If there was a limit (like labor shortage) stopping us from mining more than 1 million meals of gold per day, then it would take 900 days to mine enough gold to make the purchase.
If we are able to mine the gold at 100 million meals per day, then we could afford to purchase the gold after only 9 days of mining.


Problems for the reader:

1) If a fixed supply of shares is best, why are startups willing to dilute shares when they get investors?

2) for gold, doubling mining investment rate doubles the rate of gold production. Bitcoin is unique in that doubling the rate of investment doesn't change the rate of production at all. Can you give any reasoning for why it is bad to change the rate of production relative to investment for new coins, but good to change the rate of production to keep it at a fixed ratio to the current price of a coin?
