The market cap of bitcoin is only in the billions. We want a cryptocurrency to be in the trillions as soon as possible, so that it can be used for commerce. 

There are 2 ways to increase the market cap of a blockchain:
1) You can burn value by advertising
2) You can burn value by proof of work

The (1) method doesn't work well, because the person who pays for the advertising owns less than 1/2 of the coins, so gets less than 1/2 the profit.

Method (2) works well, but it is traditionally very limited. Bitcoin only allows for the creation of a small fixed number of new coins per day. If I had $1 trillion, and I wanted to turn it all into bitcoin, I could not do it. There aren't enough bitcoins in existence.

The following proposal is for a POW system that would allow any amount of new coins to be created in a day. If I had a $ trillion, and I wanted to turn it all into bitcoin, I could. And the bitcoin market cap would be $1 trillion higher.

It is bad to connect the consensus mechanism to the coin creation mechanism, because the rate of coin creation should be determined by the demand for new coin.

When the demand for gold goes up, we invest more into mining, and rate of gold production increases to meet demand.
When the demand for bitcoin goes up, we invest more into mining, and the rate of coin production stays static.

Having a fixed unchanging rate of supply is bad. It makes the currency price very volatile.
What we really want is for it to always cost 1000 coins of POW to produce 1000 coins.

If we disconnect the consensus from coin creation, then we can create something much more elegant. We can sell small amount of coins for small amounts of POW to determine the current exchange rate between coins and POW, then offer to sell any amount of coins at the current exchange rate. The resulting blockchain would be able to grow it's market cap very quickly when it needs to, without changing the price of individual coins.


----Startup example

Looking at an example from the startup world. Lets say you own 10% of a small company, and someone shows up to make a huge investment, buying 50% of the company at a price that makes the company worth 10x more.
Now you don't own 10%, you only own 5%, but the company is worth 10 times more, so your investment is worth 5x more, even though you have a smaller percentage of the total. Your shares got diluted, but you still earned profit.

Now compare against a blockchain example:
Imagine a blockchain with a market cap of $4 billion.
You own 10%.
An investor wants to invest in the blockchain similarly to how they invest in startups. They want to buy in very rapidly. Over the course of a week, he spends $1 billion mining the cryptocurrency.

This should dilute your shares, and increase the market cap, just like the startup example.

The new market cap $4+$1 =  $5 billion
20% is how much they paid, so they should own 20% of the coins.
You only own 8% now, not 10%, but it is worth the same amount as before.
