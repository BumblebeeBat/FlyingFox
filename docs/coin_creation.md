It is bad to connect the consensus mechanism to the coin creation mechanism, because the rate of coin creation should be determined by the demand for new coin.

When the demand for gold goes up, we invest more into mining, and rate of gold production increases to meet demand.
When the demand for bitcoin goes up, we invest more into mining, and the rate of coin production stays static.

Having a fixed unchanging rate of supply is bad. It makes the currency price very volatile.
What we really want is for it to always cost 1000 coins of POW to produce 1000 cryptocoins.

If we disconnect the consensus from coin creation, then we can create something much more elegant. We can sell small amount of coins for small amounts of POW to determine the current exchange rate between coins and POW, then offer to sell any amount of coins at the current exchange rate. The resulting blockchain would be able to grow it's market cap very quickly when it needs to, without changing the price of individual coins.
