How are Ethereum and Flying Fox different?

* Flying Fox has already moved from POW mining to a consensus mechanism similar to proof of stake.
* Flying Fox uses state channels for scalability, Ethereum uses shards.
* Flying Fox deletes old blocks, the blockchain is a small finite size of about 1 gigabytes per 4 million users.
* Flying Fox doesn't store any contract state on-chain. The state channels hold all that state.
* Flying Fox focuses on financial derivatives and prediction markets as the most important applications. Ethereum focuses on general purpose computation as most important.
* Flying Fox is a type of proof-of-burn blockchain. The total number of coins is always decreasing.
* Flying Fox is a type of delegated proof of stake blockchain. You can participate in validation without having a computer on all the time. You delegate your voting rights to someone else, and they pay you for the privilege.
