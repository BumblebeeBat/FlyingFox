Blockchain consensus is completely defined by the rules for which blocks are not allowed. Every feature is defined by censorship.

Blocks come in numerical order 4,5,6,7...
Because any block that isn't in numerical order gets censored.

Soft forks allow the addition of any censorship rule.

It seems like a soft fork could change consensus in any way.
