Blockchain consensus is completely defined by the rules for which blocks are not allowed. Every feature is defined by censorship.

Blocks come in numerical order 4,5,6,7...
Because any block that isn't in numerical order gets censored.

Soft forks allow the addition of any censorship rule.

There exists some distribution of humans who has control over soft forks. I call it the "soft fork distribution".

In short-finality systems like tendermint, it takes 2/3rds consensus of the soft for distribution for a soft fork to happen, but any 1/3rd can create an ultimatum for the other 2/3rds: Either the soft fork happens, or we stop making new blocks.

In long-finality systems like Flying Fox and Casper, it takes a simple majority to cause a soft fork.
