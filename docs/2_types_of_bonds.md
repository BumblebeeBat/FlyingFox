There are 2 seperate things you are trying to do with proof of stake bonds:

1)  If there is a double-sign, someone should get punished. Don't lock up too much excess, because it costs value to lock up value by the interest rate.

2)Measure the opinion of a large group of people who are well invested in the system, so that the decision made is in the best interest of it's users.

If you use a single set of safety deposits to do both things, then it does both things poorly.

It isn't enough money to accurately measure the opinion of the majority, so it doesn't accomplish (2) well.

It is more money than is needed to be deleted in the case of double-sign. Locking up more than necessary is expensive. So it doesn't accomplish (1) well either.

In flying fox we use the money in the channels for (2), because almost all the money is in channels. We make the validators give a safety deposit for (1), because we can make the safety deposit be the size we need.
