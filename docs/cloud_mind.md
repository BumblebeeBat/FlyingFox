Cloud Mind is a seperate blockchain from Flying Fox. It is designed to hold the state for the reporters for an oracle.
Look at channel_sidechains to see how it will maintain consensus.
Cloud Mind is written in the flying fox scripting language.
The participants are incentivized to create digital artifacts that can be used to unlock bets in flying fox channels. The participants are incentivized not to create contradictory digital artifacts.

I need to put cloud mind onto a sidechain in a channel, because the validators are paid in foxes in proportion to how much stake they have in the oracle.
