The consensus protocol is the heart of any cryptocurrency. It is a game designed so that the most successful strategy is to build a single verifiable history of who owns what money.

In bitcoin, the game's reward is in newly created coins, and transaction fees. Users who execute SHA256 computations with big computers get rewarded. The single history that is buried under the most expensive pile of computation is the correct one.

In Flying Fox, the game's reward is in fees from other participants. Users who provide liquidity and hardware for the lightning network get rewarded. The single history that is most committed to by the maintainers of the lightning network is correct.
