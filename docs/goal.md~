Flying Fox Goal

A channel is when 2 people put their money onto a small blockchain for a while. Creating the channel costs money, but once inside the channel it is free to do everything. Inside the channel the 2 participants can make any sort of bet with each other, and they can send each other the money. 

2 participants have a channel together, and they want to bet money on the outcome of an event. They give the yes/no question in ascii text, and record the hash of the question in the channel state.
In the event of a disagreement, this channel state gets published to the blockchain, and becomes the outcome of the channel.

Flying fox has questions in ascii instead of a scripting language, because each oracle might have different rules about what types of questions they support. Many will use scripting languages, others will use various human laguages.

Examples, playing a board game:
Say 2 people want to play a board game. They write the rules of the game in english, or some programming language. They update the channel state to contain the hash of the rules. They take turns updating part of the channel state that encodes the current position of the game pieces. If someone refuses to play correctly, the other person can publish the channel state onto the blockchain, and also share the rules with the oracle participants. The oracles verifies that the rules match the hash that both player signed, and uses the rules to determine how the game money should be divided up.
