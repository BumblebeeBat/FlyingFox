A blockchain has a mechanism for distributing coins. All existing distribution mechanisms fail in one of two ways:
 
1) They grow too slowly. They don't dilute shares when new investment happens. For example, in NXT, the only way to get coins is if you buy them from someone who already has some. You can't do work to create new coins.
2) They grow too fast. Miners are able to create coins at too low of a price. The excessive selling pressure from miners continuously lowers the value of shares. It is the cryptocurrency version of hyperinflation. 

All existing blockchains distribute coins poorly because they tie the coin creation mechanism to the consensus mechanism. 

Flying Fox fixes this. The consensus mechanism is disconnected from coin creation mechanism. The rate of coin creation adjusts so that it is never too slow or too fast.
