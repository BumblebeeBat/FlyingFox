Why do we have so many validators on the same block?
We want it to be very expensive for an attacker with < 1/2 the coins to control the blockchain. If the attacker has 49% of the coins, and there is only one validator per block, then he automatically has 100% control of 49% of blocks.

The way flying fox works, you need to control at least 2/3 of a block to have complete control of the order of transactions. Otherwise the other >1/3 can work together to stop you.
If an attacker has 50% of the coins, he will only have control over 1 in 25 blocks. Those gaps are too big for him to afford to jump. So he can't have complete control over the blockchain.
